Week 1
This week I used AI on a few of my assignments. I used ChatGPT to help me design supply and demand curves for my economics class. The visual aids are helpful in determining how the graph might change if there are non-price determinants or if there is positive or negative influence to a change in a product. Otherwise, since classes are just kicking off, I haven't used AI too much. I haven't had any code to debug, I have not had any long reading assignments I needed summarized or briefly explained.
